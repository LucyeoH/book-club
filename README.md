decades of data from hundreds of product categories.

## Fiction


### Near future science fiction

Sterling, Bruce. [Islands in the
Net](https://openroadmedia.com/ebook/Islands-in-the-Net/9781497686519).
(Also a helpful guide to working as part of a globally
distributed team.)

Suarez, Daniel. [Daemon](http://thedaemon.com/).
(Only a few "user stories" away from implemetation
by now, so you might as well read it and get a little
bit of advance warning.)


### Urban fantasy

O'Malley, Daniel. [The
Rook](http://www.rookfiles.com/).  Woman awakens in
park, in a rainstorm, with no memory of her previous
life or career.  Turns out that she's in a book
written by the mutant spawn of J.K. Rowling and
Charles Stross.
